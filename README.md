# WordSolver (Web)

## About

Furthering my skills in React.js - creating a web version of my WordSolver app.
This app helps users play Scrabble, hang man or Words With Friends.

## How to use

To use this app, you need to query the word list based on different query parameters.
A basic filter is something you'd type into the text input boxes (those squares) like so:

//ION

Where, in the above case, the word is a 5-letter word ending in the characters ION. Hit the basic filter button and the word list will filter everything out to only show words that match that query (ie 5-letter words ending in "ION").

There will be various types of queries available, and they will be added via buttons that will appear in the query pane.

## Tech skills

Node.js
React.js
HTML / CSS / Javascript / maybe some jQuery? 

And Web Workers - I'll use Webworkers to minimize blocking of the UI when the word list (which is quite large) is being loaded.
