# WordSolver (Web)

## About

Furthering my skills in React.js - creating a web version of my WordSolver app.
This app helps users play Scrabble, hang man or Words With Friends.

## How to use

To use this app, you need to query the word list based on different query parameters.
A basic filter is something you'd type into the text input boxes (those squares) like so:

//ION

Where the word is a 5-letter word ending in the characters ION. Hit the basic filter button and the word list will filter out to only
show words that match that query.

There will be various types of queries available, and they will be added via buttons that will appear in the query pane.
